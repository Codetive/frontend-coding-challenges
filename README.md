## Introduction

This repository is part of the **Codetive** learning platform which launches in September 2024.

The questions are organized by:
- **Category**
  - 🥊 **Coding challenges**: Solve coding problems with our built-in code editor, complete with a preview, console, and automated tests—just like LeetCode! [practical, interview, algorithms, apis]

  - 📝 **Trivia questions**: Test your knowledge with quick, engaging web development quizzes. [quick, fun, reinforced learning, not practical for interview]

  - 📦**Components**: Tackle frontend challenges with provided UI and Figma files to bring designs to life. [interview, portfolio, practical, ui, figma]

- **Difficulty**
  - Beginner
  - Intermediate
  - Advanced
  - Expert

- **Language**
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Javascript
  - Typescript
  - Tailwind
  - React (soon...)
  - Nextjs (soon...)
  - Nodejs (soon...)
  
  
On top of that, on Codetive app all questions and challenges are sorted by tags such as **portoflio**, **interview**, **first job** etc.

Codetive app will allow you to track progress, suggest weak areas and prepare learning paths for you.

*Coding challenges and components are work in progress...*

The trivia questions are organized by technology (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript) and difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert).

> **Note:** Trivia and are intended for fun and educational purposes. They are not necessarily reflective of the types of questions you would encounter in a real interview. So if you're preparing for an interview skip them or check out only advanced/expert ones, don't spend much time on them though.
